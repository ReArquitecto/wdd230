                <p>Visual hierarchy is the way elements on a web page are arranged in order of importance. By using visual cues such as size, color, and placement, designers can guide users' attention to the most important elements on the page. This can improve the usability and accessibility of a website, making it easier for users to find the information they need and complete tasks. </p>

                <p>Fitt's Law states that the time it takes for a user to move their cursor to a specific target on a screen is directly proportional to the distance of the target and the size of the target. It's very important to keep in mind how close different functions of an app are in realation to each other. We also don't want mobile users to have to reach to the top of the screen. </p>
